    Our story begins with our hero, Hercules, as he was training with Chiron the centaur.)

    "Hercules! I told you, you have have to keep your shield arm up while attacking!"

    "Chiron, no one is able to hurt me. Why do I have to even have to bother with this shield?")

    "You'll change your opinion if you are struck with an arrow that's been coated with the blood of Nessus because you

    didn't keep your shield arm up."

    At that moment, Hermes suddenly appeared in a flash of light.

    "Hermes. What brings you here, my nimble friend?"

    "I'm here on official business Chiron. King Eurystheus has tasked Hercules with a few tasks that must be 

    completed. These tasks will be incredibly difficult and only Hercules can do it I'm afraid."

    "Did you hear that Hercules? Maybe you'll actually be able to put to use something that I've taught you."

    "What does King Eurystheus have in mind for me Hermes?"
    
    "He has three things in mind for you, actually. They will not be the easiest of tasks either."
    
    "Well, let's get on with it Hermes. My student has better things to do than run errands for some King."
    
    "Very well, Chiron. These are the tasks that King Eurystheus demands to be completed."
    
    "First: He must slay the vicious Nemean Lion."
    
    "Second: He must defeat the impossible nine-headed Lernaean Hydra."
    
    "Third: He must capture the guard dog of the underworld...Cerberus."
